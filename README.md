# 🧬 Cancer Prediction Model using Dimensionality Reduction techniques and RNN-CNN Classifier

This project replicates and enhances a research paper titled **"RNN-CNN Based Cancer Prediction Model for Gene Expression"**. The paper proposed a hybrid deep learning model combining **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for cancer prediction using gene expression data. However, the original implementation showed low accuracy, prompting us to explore **feature selection** and **feature extraction** techniques to improve model performance.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source**: [Dataset-1](https://github.com/Sonali9867/Cancer_Prediction_Model/blob/main/DATASET-1.csv)
- **Format**: CSV file with rows as samples and columns as gene expression features + target label
- **Shape**: 2086 rows × 972 columns (971 gene expression features + 1 target label)
- **Target**: Cancer type
- **Classes** (5 types):
  - BRCA: Breast Invasive Carcinoma
  - KIRC: Kidney Renal Cell Carcinoma
  - LUAD: Lung Adenocarcinoma
  - LUSC: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  - UCEC: Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma

Each row in the dataset represents a patient sample, and the columns represent normalized RNA-Seq gene expression levels for 971 genes. The final column contains the corresponding cancer type.
